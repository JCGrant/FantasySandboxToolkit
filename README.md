# Fantasy Sandbox Toolkit
Inspired by Eric Vulgaris' [*Sandboxes From Scratch*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEPoXcdz0dU) video.

In the video, Eric uses an excel spreadsheet of described locations, and then follows an algorithm to generate a small portion of a fantasy world, using those locations.

This app does all that work for you, allowing you to get on with creating your setting.

## How do I use this?

This app is designed to be used with [Hexographer](http://www.hexographer.com/), or any of map making tool!

If you're unsure how to proceed, I'd reccomend watching the video above to get an idea of how Eric creates his Sandbox.

## Demo
You can see a demo of the web app [here](https://jcgrant.github.io/fantasy-sandbox-toolkit/)!
